It's preety simple to run a local Nginx web server for test purposes.

First of all we need to pull the Nginx docker image

```shell
docker pull nginx
```

Now we can run it:

```shell
docker run \
--name blog-nginx \
-p 80:80 \
-v ~/Git/blog/dist/:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro \
-d nginx
```

Here we specify port forwarding with the **-p** option and mount the web directory for Nginx through the **-v** option.

That's it, now we have a running Nginx that serves our content.
