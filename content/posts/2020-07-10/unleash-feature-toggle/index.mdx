Unleash is a feature toggle system that might be set-up in a minutes!
In this post, I want to show a quick set-up demo for this powerful tool.

## Prerequisites
For the infrastructure setup, it's required to have __Docker__ and __docker-compose__.
For the demo app build it's required to have __Java > 11__ and __Gradle__.

## Prepare the infrastructure
To run the Unleash server we need to have ```Node.js >= 12 and a PostgreSQL >= 10```
For the demo purposes let's use docker images of __Unleash__ and __PostgreSQL__.

I've prepared the following `docker-compose.yml`:
```dockerfile
version: "3"
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=unleash
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${POSTGRES_PASS}
  unleash:
    image: unleashorg/unleash-server
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:${POSTGRES_PASS}@postgres:5432/unleash
    restart: on-failure
    ports:
      - "4242:4242"
```

It'll create both __Postgres__ and __Unleash__ containers and will expose the 4242 port of __Unleash__, so we'll be able to access the Unleash management UI.

Now you can open _localhost:4242_ in your browser and to play with the __Unleash UI__.

  <img
    src="./images/unleash_ui.png"
    title="Unleash UI"
    alt="Unleash UI"
  />
</div>

## Unleash in action
I've prepared an application that fetches all available toggles from the __Unleash server__ and shows their statuses.

<div className="Image__Medium">

    src="./images/UnleashDemo.gif"
    title="Unleash demo"
    alt="Unleash demo"
  />
</div>

## Unleash client
For the moment, the official Unleash client SDKs available for:
- Java
- Python
- Node.js
- Go
- Ruby
- .Net

## Unleash client configuration (Java example)
The client API is self-descriptive, so I'll just show you the code:
```java
var unleashConfig = UnleashConfig.builder()
        .appName("UnleashDemo")
        .instanceId("Instance 1")
        .unleashAPI("http://127.0.0.1:4242/api")
        .fetchTogglesInterval(10)
        .subscriber(new UnleashSubscriber() {
            @Override
            public void togglesFetched(FeatureToggleResponse toggleResponse) {
                logger.info("Fetched toggles");
            }

            @Override
            public void onError(UnleashException unleashException) {
                logger.info("Error: {}", unleashException.getMessage());
            }
        })
        .build();

var unleash = new DefaultUnleash(unleashConfig);
```

Once you created the client, you can just use it like:

```java
if (unleash.isEnabled("someFeature")) {
    // someFeature code
}
```

## Important places to notice
Unleash client has the backup mechanism. By default, the client fetches the server every 10 seconds.
Once the client fetched the toggles it creates the local backup file in the temp directory (can be overridden by specific file).

This means that if the unleash-server becomes unavailable, the unleash-client will still be able to toggle the features based on the values stored in unleash-repo.json.

And here you may face unexpected behavior when you receive outdated information about toggles because your Unleash server is down or something went wrong.
For better diagnostics of that problem don't forget to add the `onError` subscriber to the unleash client.
